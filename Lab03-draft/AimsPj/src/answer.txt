a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

**Question (section 15): 
●Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?

JAVA is a pass by value language


● After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two
objects still remain?

	In the original swap method, the params o1 and o2 are references to objects, not
	the values. So the swap method just swap the references of the objects but their
	values


● After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is
the title of the JungleDVD changed?
	
	In this call, the changeTitle method update the title of jungleDVD to the title of
	cinderellaDVD. The reason it worked is because the objects are modified within the
	method, so you can actually changing its title by "value" and not by "reference".
