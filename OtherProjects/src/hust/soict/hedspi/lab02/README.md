# About the workflow

Dear Teacher/TA, I would like to inform you some problem with my assigment.

I initially referred to an older version of the assignment document, and I applied the old release flow to my project (instead of the new one as mentioned in the latest version of the document):

- feature/use_case_diagram
- feature/class_diagram
- feature/aims_class
- feature/digital_video_disc
- feature/constructor
- feature/cart_class
- feature/carts
- feature/remove_items
- feature/method_overloading
- feature/passing_parameters
- feature/classifier_and_instance_member

After realizing this, I have decided to stick with the old flow to avoid any potential conflicts with the new flow. This means that I can not refactor my branch to comply with the new flow.

Besides, regarding the folder structure, in the document mentions that the .astah and .png file of the class diagram should be placed in the Design folder. But while working with the diagrams, i accidentally saved both the class and use-case diagrams in the same .astah file so i can not seperate into each file and apply the required folder structure.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvinience this may cause. I have tried to complete the tasks as in the new document, still. But if this causes any difficulty in managing and evaluating the assignment, please let me know if you have any specific requirements or changes should be made for my submitted assigment.

Thank you for your reading.
